# Alpine Linux Dockerfile


To have a small base to start I set my one Dockerfiles with a alpine linuxe base. I like alpine linux because of the extremly small footprint.

Three Dockerfiles are set.

1.    Alpine Version 3.6
2.    Alpine Version latest
3.    Alpine Version EDGE

The other repositores are going to inherent from one of the base Images.
